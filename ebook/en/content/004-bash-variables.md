# Bash Variables

As in any other programming language, you can use variables in Bash Scripting as well. However, there are no data types, and a variable in Bash can contain numbers as well as characters.

To assign a value to a variable, all you need to do is use the `=` sign:

```bash
name="DevDojo"
```
