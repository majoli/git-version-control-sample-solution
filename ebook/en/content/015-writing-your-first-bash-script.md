# Write your first Bash script

Let's try to put together what we've learned so far and create our first Bash script!

## Planning the script

As an example, we will write a script that would gather some useful information about our server like:

* Current Disk usage
* Current CPU usage
* Current RAM usage
* Check the exact Kernel version

Feel free to adjust the script by adding or removing functionality so that it matches your needs.
